BUBBLES APP

- If the arrow hits the bubble, the bubble turns green.
- The "Reset" button smoothly resets the arrow to its original position.

How to Run:

1. Extract the zip file.
2. Open 'index.html' in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
3. Click "Hit" to start the animation.
4. After the hit is detected, click "Reset" to smoothly return the arrow to the starting point.
